&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Ah. Yes. Good afternoon, Miss White. I&apos;m calling from Color Day&apos;s Preschool. The headmaster was very impressed with you after your interview with her. After reviewing all other applicants, she has decided to give you the position of teacher&apos;s assistant.&quot;

&quot;Oh my gosh! Really?&quot;

&quot;Mmhm. That&apos;s right. Now before you say &quot;yes&quot;, i&apos;m going to read to you some of the responsibilities you&apos;ll need to take on for the job: &quot;You must engage the children, respect them. Clean after them, guide them. And most of all-&quot;

&quot;-Treat them as if they were your own children! Got it.&quot;

&quot;**Chuckles** I believe you&apos;ve already shown your prowess with the kids the other day in front of the headmaster, so she&apos;s waved off your &quot;test drive&quot;. She&apos;d like you to start next Monday, would that be okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that would totally be okay! Thank you for this opportunity. I&apos;m very, very grateful.&quot;

&quot;Alright now, have a good day.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s already great! Have a great day to you too. Bye.&quot;

Parent Waiting Room
The room is a modestly sized rectangular room. Lining the pastel yellow walls are wooden armchairs. In the center of the room, there is a glass coffee table. On it is a neatly stacked pile of magazines. Next to the glass door is a water dispenser machine, with cups on top. Against the north wall is the Reception Desk. Somebody is sitting behind the desk. To the West is the Parking Lot. To the South is the Office.

The teachers don&apos;t really need to grade anything, so only the administration workers need cubicles. There are only four cubicles, two on each side of the walk way at the center. To the West is the Headmaster&apos;s Office. To the North is the Parent Waiting Room. To the South is the Playground.
