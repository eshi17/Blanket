&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Ah. Yes. Good afternoon, Miss White. I am the Headmaster of Sunny Day Preschool, Miss Graham. I was very impressed with you after your interview the other day. After reviewing all other applicants, I&apos;ve decided to give you the position of teacher&apos;s assistant.&quot;

&quot;Oh my gosh! Really?&quot;

&quot;Mmhm. That&apos;s right. Now before you say &quot;yes&quot;, I&apos;m going to read to you some of the responsibilities you&apos;ll need to take on for the job: &quot;You must engage the children, respect them. Clean after them, guide them. And most of all-&quot;

&quot;-Treat them as if they were your own children! Got it.&quot;

&quot;**Chuckles** You&apos;ve already shown your prowess with the kids the other day, so I&apos;m waved off your &quot;test drive&quot;. I&apos;d like you to start next Monday, would that be okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that would totally be okay! Thank you for this opportunity. I&apos;m very, very grateful.&quot;

&quot;Alright now, have a good day.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s already great! Have a great day to you too. Bye.&quot;

Monday:

After slamming the car door shut, you gracefully walk across the Parking Lot towards the school. This is your first day in the real world. After four years of training, this is what you&apos;ve been waiting for. You push open the glass doors and enter into the Parent Waiting Room. You glance around,

The teachers don&apos;t really need to grade anything, so only the administration workers need cubicles. There are only four cubicles, two on each side of the walk way at the center.

Classroom
A somewhat large room, walls covered in posters. The floor is cluttered with toys and furniture. Small children run around, screaming at each other. Some of the younger children sit dumbly on a brightly colored rug, chewing on some poor plastic toy. There is a large window on the west wall, overlooking the playground. Along the four walls are cubby holes. The Office is to the North, and the Playground is to the West. Mrs. Green, the teacher, stands by the window, consoling a crying child.

Classroom
A somewhat large room, walls covered in posters. The floor is cluttered with toys and furniture. Small children run around, screaming at each other. Some of the younger children sit dumbly on a brightly colored rug, chewing on some poor plastic toy. There is a large window on the west wall, overlooking the playground. Along the four walls are cubby holes and shelves. The Office is to the North, and the Playground is to the West. Mrs. Green, the teacher, stands by the window, consoling a crying child.

Playground
An open grassy space for the children to play in. There is a small plastic jungle gym at the center of the space for the older kids to play in. Next to it is a large wooden sandbox. Scattered around the grass are jump ropes, balls, and a plastic toy cart. Sounds of giggling children come from the Classroom, to the East.

Classroom
A somewhat large room, walls covered in posters. The floor is cluttered with toys and furniture. Small children run around, screaming at each other. Some of the younger children sit dumbly on a brightly colored rug, chewing on some poor plastic toy. There is a large window on the west wall, overlooking the playground. Along the four walls are cubby holes. The Office is to the North, and the Playground is to the West. Mrs. Green, the teacher, stands by the window, consoling a crying child.

Classroom
A somewhat large room, walls covered in posters. The floor is cluttered with toys and furniture. Small children run around, screaming at each other. Some of the younger children sit dumbly on a brightly colored rug, chewing on some poor plastic toy. There is a large window on the west wall, overlooking the playground. Along the four walls are cubby holes and shelves. The Office is to the North, and the Playground is to the West. Mrs. Green, the teacher, stands by the window, consoling a crying child.

Office
The teachers don&apos;t really need to grade anything, so only the administration workers need cubicles. There are only four cubicles, two on each side of the walk way at the center. As you scan the room, a woman walks past. Her nametag reads &quot;Miss Graham: Headmaster&quot;. To the North is the Parent Waiting Room. To the West is the Lounge. To the South is the Classroom.

Classroom
A somewhat large room, walls covered in posters. The floor is cluttered with toys and furniture. Small children run around, screaming at each other. Some of the younger children sit dumbly on a brightly colored rug, chewing on some poor plastic toy. There is a large window on the west wall, overlooking the playground. Along the four walls are cubby holes and shelves. The Office is to the North, and the Playground is to the West. Mrs. Green, the teacher, stands by the window, consoling a crying child.
