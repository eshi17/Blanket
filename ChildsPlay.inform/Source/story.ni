"Child's Play" by Elana Shi

[title changed from Blanket to Child's Play to keep the player from knowing the objective before playing]

When Play begins, say "Alice White: a freshly graduated girl, who succeeds in getting her first job as a teacher’s assistant at Sunny Day Preschool. She is passionate about what she does and is enthusiastic about doing well on her first job in the ‘real world’. Her first task at the school is to help the teacher, Miss Green, to get a child to stop crying.

'Hello?'

'Ah. Yes. Good afternoon, Miss White. I am the Headmaster of Sunny Day Preschool, Miss Graham. I was very impressed with you after your interview the other day. After reviewing all other applicants, I've decided to give you the position of teacher’s assistant.'

'Oh my gosh! Really?'

'Mmhm. That’s right. Now before you say ‘yes’, I’m going to read to you some of the responsibilities you’ll need to take on for the job: 'You must engage the children, respect them. Clean after them, guide them. And most of all—'

'—Treat them as if they were your own children! Got it.'

'**Chuckles** You’ve already shown your prowess with the kids the other day, so I've waved off your 'test drive'. I’d like you to start next Monday, would that be okay?'

'Yeah, that would totally be okay! Thank you for this opportunity. I’m very, very grateful.'

'Alright now, have a good day.'

'It’s already great! Have a great day to you too. Bye.'

Monday:

After slamming the car door shut, you gracefully walk across the Parking Lot towards the school. This is your first day in the real world. After four years of training, this is what you’ve been waiting for. You push open the glass doors and enter into the Parent Waiting Room. You glance around,


~"

[I really tried to show some character emotion here. The player is passionate, yet a little sassy. She's ready to enter into the real world.]

Description of Parent Waiting Room is "The room is a modestly sized rectangular room. Lining the pastel yellow walls are wooden armchairs. Against the north wall is the reception desk. There is a girl sitting behind the desk. To the West is the Parking Lot. To the South is the Office."

I need a dollar to take the bus, and those quarter's are gonna get me home. If you can give me a dollar bill or something, then you can take it.' You recall that you left your wallet inside the car." [I had to think about how to do this for a bit.]

[As I described things, I realized I would describe the object by introducing more objects. This got tedious.]

The girl is woman in Parent Waiting Room. The Girl is undescribed. Description of The Girl is "She is sitting behind the desk, furiously texting into her phone. She doesn't even notice that you've walked up to her."

Instead of giving the Dollar Bill to The Girl: say "You hand her the Dollar Bill, and she nods her head to the Ceramic Pig. 'You can take four quarters.' You take the Ceramic Pig, and pull the rubber stopper from under it. Gently shaking the Ceramic Pig, four quarters fall into your palm. You put the Ceramic Pig back, and thank the girl."; remove the Dollar Bill from play; move Quarters to player. [Mrs Kiang's A Day for Spelling]

Understand "speaking" as talking.

Talking to is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "talk to [someone]" or “speak to
[someone]” as talking to.
Check talking to: say "[The noun] doesn't reply."
[Jim Aikin's Inform Handbook. This is one of the stranger commands that I probably could not figure out myself.]

Instead of Talking to Girl, say "She looks up briefly, then back down to her phone. She nonchalantly says, 'You're with Miss Green. I recommend you speak to Miss Green first. To get to her classroom, you’ll have to go through the office.'"

[Parking Lot]
Parking Lot is a room.
Description of Parking Lot is "A large parking lot. There aren’t a lot of cars in the lot right now, but a couple hours later and it’ll be jam packed. Your car is parked in front of you. To the East is the Parent Waiting Room." Parking Lot is west of Parent Waiting Room.

Office is a room. South of Parent Waiting Room is Office. Description of Office is "The teachers don’t really need to grade anything, so only the administration workers need cubicles. There are only four cubicles, two on each side of the walk way at the center. As you scan the room, a woman walks past. Her nametag reads 'Miss Graham: Headmaster'. To the North is the Parent Waiting Room. To the West is the Lounge. To the South is the Classroom."

Miss Graham is woman. [Jim Aikin's Inform Handbook. I really enjoyed making NPCs. I feel like they can give a story another strong force of "life".] Miss Graham is in Office. Miss Graham is undescribed. Description of Miss Graham is "A woman in her late 50's, she looks impressively fit. Wearing a smart black suit, Miss Graham has an air of authority surrounding her."
Instead of talking to Miss Graham, say "You approach Miss Graham, and she turns to you. She smiles and says 'Hello, Miss White. I hope your first day is going well. If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to ask me. Now move along, you should be in Miss Green's classroom.'" [I had to add in that last part saying move along because some of my beta testers had no idea what they needed to do. The NPCs also acted as a guide.]
Instead of asking Miss Graham about "Brown Cloth", say "You show her the brown Cloth and explain the situation. She laughs and says, 'Don't worry. There's a washer-dryer machine in the faculty lounge. You can wash the blanket there." [This dialogue was optional, but I put it in so players can have a hint without feeling super guilty.]
Instead of asking Miss Graham about "Blanket", say "You tell her about George's blanket, and ask if she might know anything. She replies, 'Hmm, I'm not sure where it is. The kids usually play in the playground, so you could check there.'"

Cubicles are scenery in Office. Description of Cubicles are "These belong to the office administration workers. You shouldn’t go in… they’re working pretty hard inside." [just to add to the setting]

[Lounge]

Washer-Dryer Machine is locked container. Description of Washer-Dryer Machine is "The MACHINE is combination of both washing machine and drying machine, a practical necessity for a preschool! The only problem is you need to insert quarters into the machine to UNLOCK the lid in order to open the machine. There should be a bowl full of quarters on the table." [I had to capitalize unlock to emphasize the fact that you had to unlock the washer-dryer machine. I capitalized machine so that people knew they could type machine, because washer-dryer is a mouthfull.]

Understand "washer" as Washer-Dryer Machine.

Quarters unlock the Washer-Dryer Machine.
After opening Washer-Dryer Machine, remove Quarters from play. [Mrs. Kiang's A Day for Spelling. I really liked this removing and moving command. It opens up a lot of possibilities.]

Putting to is an action applying to one visible thing.

An every turn rule:
	If Brown Cloth is in Washer-Dryer Machine: 
		say "You adjust the options to 'Speed Wash' and press the Power Button. The washer-dryer whirs to life, and you wait 15 minutes before a beeping sound blares from the machine. You take out George's blanket, now soft and fresh (and blue).";
		remove Brown Cloth from play; 
		move Blanket to player. [Originally this is where the game ended. I had the player put the blanket in, and immedietly they were faced with a large box of text. I decided against that and tried to make more interaction to extend the game and lessen the large text boxes.]

		
[Classroom]
Classroom is a room. Classroom is south of Office. Description of Classroom is "A somewhat large room, walls covered in posters. The floor is cluttered with toys and furniture. Small children run around, screaming at each other. Some of the younger children sit dumbly on a brightly colored rug, chewing on some poor plastic toy.
